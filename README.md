Key Relationships:

- Users can have multiple Orders (One-to-Many)
- Restaurants can have multiple Menu Items (One-to-Many)
- Orders can have multiple Order Items (One-to-Many)
- Menu Items belong to Categories (Many-to-One)

**🛠️ Laravel Components Implementation**

Route::get('/restaurants/{restaurant}', [RestaurantController::class, 'show'])->name('restaurants.show');

`// Customer Protected Routes`
Route::middleware(['auth', 'customer'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [CustomerController::class, 'dashboard'])->name('customer.dashboard');
    Route::resource('orders', OrderController::class);
    Route::post('/cart/add', [CartController::class, 'add'])->name('cart.add');
});

`// Restaurant Owner Protected Routes`
Route::middleware(['auth', 'restaurant'])->group(function () {
